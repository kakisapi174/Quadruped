Components Used:

1 piece Arduino nano

1 piece Arduino nano I/O shield

8 pieces of  sg90 or mg90 Servo 

1 set of quadruped shell (https://www.tokopedia.com/office3d/spider-robot-arduino-quadruped-robot-arduino-print-3d-full-rangka?utm_campaign=PDP-20222269-1575831973-0-250324-default&utm_source=salinlink&utm_medium=share)

1 piece 2 cell LiPo Batterey with 3000 mAh

1 piece bluetooth module (HC-05)

For the next steps you can reference the file "Label".

Connect each servo to the I/o Shield accordingly:
(Make sure that the robot orientation is correct such that there is no error in labeling the servos)
Servo A = pin2
Servo B = pin8
Servo C = pin4
Servo D = pin6
Servo 1 = pin3
Servo 2 = pin9
Servo 3 = pin5
Servo 4 = pin7

When building the robot, make sure that the Servos are in the idle position before tightening it with the screws.

to adjust the servos to the idle position, open the source code file and modify the void loop section:

void loop() {
	Idle();
}

after the body's assembly is done, connect the HC-05 module accordingly:
Vcc = 5V
Gnd = Gnd
RXD = TX
TXD = RX

After all's done re type the original source code, than upload it to the robot.
